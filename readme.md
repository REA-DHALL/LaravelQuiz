# LaraQuiz: Laravel 5.6 based quiz system

It is a demo project for demonstrating what can be generated with [QuickAdminPanel](https://quickadminpanel.com) tool.
LaraQuiz was mostly generated with __QuickAdmin__ except for some custom code.

It's an open-source version of online Laravel quiz at [LaraQuiz.com](http://laraquiz.com) - but the system can be used for any quiz project, you just fill in different topics and questions.

__Notice__: originally created with Laravel 5.3, it was upgraded to Laravel 5.6 in March 2018.
